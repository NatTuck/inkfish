    <h1>Check Your Email</h1>
    <p>You should get an email from "<tt><%= @from_email %></tt>".</p>
    <p>It could take a couple minutes to arrive.</p>
    <p><b>Remember to check your spam folder.</b> This email will almost
      certainly go there, since it's email directly from a suspicious
      web server.</p>
